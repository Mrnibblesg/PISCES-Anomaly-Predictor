# PISCES-Anomaly-Predictor
An application that utilizes PISCES data to predict system anomalies, drawing from relevant research.



## Genreal approach and goal: 

  Implement a open source framework/project that helps analysts detect and predict malicious network activity. 
  
  
  
  
  ## Possible Data points:
  
  * Traffic spike anomolies
  *  unusual ports
  *  large connection volume
  *  termporal anamolies
  *  flow persestience
  *  long duration connections
  *  failed logins
  *  known IPs
  *  new devices
  *  location


## Dates:
* Sprint 1:
  *  Narrow in on research approach
  *  Determine collection/access method for data

* By midterm:
  * Have a working PoC/MVP
  *
