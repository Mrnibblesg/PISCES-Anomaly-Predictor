# PISCES-Anomaly-Predictor
An application that utilizes PISCES data to predict system anomalies, drawing from relevant research.



## Genreal approach and goal: 

Implement an open source framework/project that helps analysts detect and predict malicious network activity.



    
  ## Possible Data points:
  
* Traffic spike anomalies

* unusual ports

* large connection volume

* temporal anomalies

* flow persistence

* long duration connections

* failed logins

* known IPs

* new devices

* location


## Dates:
* Sprint 1:
  *  Narrow in on research approach
  *  Determine collection/access method for data

* By midterm:
  * Have a working PoC/MVP
  *
