# PISCES-Anomaly-Predictor
An application that utilizes PISCES data to predict system anomalies, drawing from relevant research.



## Genreal approach and goal: 

Implement an open source framework/project that helps analysts detect and predict network anomalies.
We will be implementing TadGAN, which is time-series anomaly detection with GANs.
